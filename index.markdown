Hello! I am a PhD student in Demography at UC Berkeley. I study questions at the intersection of computational demography, mortality, and kinship. Much of my recent work explores how population-level mortality is experienced at the individual level as kin loss, and what impacts these experiences may have on surviving relatives.
