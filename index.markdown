Hello! I am a PhD student in Demography at UC Berkeley. I am fascinated by questions at the intersection of computational demography, mortality, and kinship. Much of my recent work explores how population-level mortality is experienced at the individual level as kin loss, and what impacts those experiences may have on surviving relatives. 

You can reach me at my email, mallikasnyder{at}berkeley{dot}edu.
